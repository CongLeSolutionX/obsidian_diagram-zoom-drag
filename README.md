# mermaid-zoom-drag-plugin
In obsidian, when you have a md file which contains large charts or diagrams, maybe something of mermaid, you will see those things are too large to show in mermaid window.  So i think it is a good way to take the obsidian plugin here. It could easily zoom in or zoom-out or drag the charts or diagrams of mermaid.  Enjoy it!
