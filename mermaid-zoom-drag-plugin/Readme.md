In obsidian, when you have a md file which contains large charts or diagrams, maybe something else of mermaid, you will see those things are too large to show completely in mermaid window. So i think it is a good way to take the obsidian plugin here. It adapts those things of mermaid, and it could easily that let you zoom in or zoom-out or drag. Enjoy it!
